Project: A Voting App
Developed By: Fahim Mahmud Akber
For: Project X Ltd.

//Concept:

I have followed the instructions that you sent me by mail. Here, User can register once and can log in. In both
case user have to use fingerprint. Without fingerprint no one can get access. Admin can add new VOTE, and see
the vote result, who has casted vote.

To get access as Admin, i have used a fixed data

    id: 1234567890
    pass: admin@1234

No one can get access as admin without this credential.

An user can cast his vote only once. In the home page s/he can see today's vote(if any vote available today)
and upcoming vote. S/he has to only click on the today's vote to cast his vote.

I HAVE USED FIREBASE DATABASE TO STORE DATA
